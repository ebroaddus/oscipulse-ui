# OsciPulse User Interface
This repository contains files relating to the OsciFlex LLC's OsciPulse minimum viable product User Interface. The user interface was entirely designed in the Arduino language, as an Arduino microprocessor was used for the MVP. This software takes a variety of inputs from the user via buttons on the OsciPulse device, processes said inputs, and outputs results directly to the OLED screen on the front. The result is an intuitive first iteration of a user interface that can be further improved with higher resolution screen and aesthetic design.
